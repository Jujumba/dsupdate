The situation: a new Discord version is rolled out. Your package manager falls behind. You are too lazy to manually update via a tarball.

Familiar?

This program makes Discord _think_ it's already been updated. Just copy the _latest_  version (it's written at the bottom left corner of Discord's updater) and run the following:

```shell
$ dsupdate <latest>
```

After the launch, Discord will update itself
